This project focuses on analyzing global coffee production and its impact on economic patterns using data science tools in a Jupyter notebook. Key libraries used include Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualizations. Through this analysis, we explore trends in coffee production across countries, and international imports.

# About Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains detailed records of coffee production and associated economic data from key producing countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ethiopia. Along with production data, it includes import volumes from major coffee-importing nations and price trends paid to growers over time. The analysis provides insights into price fluctuations, country-specific production efficiency, and how these affect global coffee exports.

### Dataset Fields:
- **Production Data**: Annual coffee production data per country, measured in metric tons.
- **Prices Paid to Growers**: The price growers receive per kilogram of coffee, in local currency.
- **Import Data**: Import volumes of coffee by country.

This dataset serves as the foundation for understanding global coffee market dynamics.

# Questions Analyzed

1. What are the annual trends in coffee production for major producing countries (e.g., Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia)?
2. How have prices paid to coffee growers changed over time?
3. What are the top coffee-importing nations, and how do their import volumes compare over the years?
4. Is there a relationship between production volumes and prices paid to growers?
5. Which countries have shown the highest growth rates in coffee production?
6. How do fluctuations in production volumes affect coffee prices in the international market?
7. Are there any seasonal trends or patterns in coffee production or imports?

# Summary of Findings

- **Coffee Production Trends**: Brazil consistently leads in coffee production, with a steady increase in output over the years. Ethiopia and Colombia follow as major producers, though their growth rates have been more moderate.
  
- **Prices Paid to Growers**: Prices paid to growers have fluctuated significantly over time, with notable dips during periods of oversupply in the global market. Brazil shows a more stable price trend compared to other countries, such as Vietnam, where prices are more volatile.

- **Top Importing Nations**: The United States and Germany consistently rank as top importers, with increasing volumes over the years. Their import volumes closely track global consumption trends.

- **Production vs. Price Relationship**: There is an inverse relationship between production volumes and prices paid to growers. For instance, when Brazil experiences a bumper crop, the global market price tends to decrease, affecting the income of coffee growers in all producing countries.

- **Growth Rates in Coffee Production**: Vietnam has shown the highest growth rate in coffee production, expanding its market share in recent years, while traditional producers like Colombia have seen slower growth.

- **Impact of Production on Prices**: In years of overproduction, global coffee prices have dropped, resulting in lower income for growers, especially in countries where coffee is a key economic commodity.

- **Seasonal Patterns**: There is evidence of seasonal production patterns, especially in countries like Ethiopia, where harvest seasons are aligned with specific weather conditions. However, the import patterns in consuming countries do not show strong seasonal variation, indicating year-round demand.


# Limitations of the Findings:
- Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and inflation are not accounted for, which may affect the accuracy of price comparisons.
- The dataset does not provide information on the quality of the coffee beans, which may influence pricing and market trends.
- Missing data for certain countries in specific years could skew results, particularly when analyzing global trends.
